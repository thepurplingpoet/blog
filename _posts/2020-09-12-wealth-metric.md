title: A robust measure of wealth

## How wealthy, rich and successful are you? 
Interesting question. But don't we all know the answer? The money you have in your bank is your wealth and that is a signal of your success. Hmm. Let me give a counterfactual argument: Suppose your bank collapses. Or you lose all your money in a sports betting game. Or your business fails. Or your evil twin steals all your money and burns down your house. Yes, this is an extremely pessimistic thought-process and in most likelihood, your money in the bank is a proxy for your "wealthy-ness". But, I propose these two questions (you might have heard variations of these, so they're not completely "original") that give a much better measure of "true" wealth.
- <b>If you lost all your sources of income today, how long would you be able to survive without further addition to your wealth? 
- If all your wealth (including investments in markets, real estate etc) becomes zero today, how long would you take to get it back to the current level?</b>

So how do we go about making our wealth robust against the extremities of the above questions? I am not the right person to answer, to be honest. But from what little I have observed, it boils down to two <b>acquisitions</b>: <b>Acquiring businesses and acquiring skills</b>. I'll add in a third just to play safe. <b>Reputation</b>. 

Acquiring businesses can help diversify income sources and help protect against those pesky rare events that sometimes are also called "hand of God". Acquiring skills increase the ability to earn through multiple dimensions in case God decides to use their feet as well. 

Think of doctors. They have a skill that will most certainly keep feeding their source of income for the rest of their lives. Their skill component is in a very good shape. If they also purchase businesses, say through investing in a hospital (so original, right?) or buying shares of an up-and-coming pharma company (are doctors not allowed to do anything other than medicine?), they build robustness against those times when there are not enough patients visiting them(must be a really good doc, eh? ). 

Reputation and fame can be pretty powerful and they have an obnoxiousnly high reward to effort ratio. However, it takes a lot of luck and in some cases, a lot more hard work. One example could be "influencers" but you need a pretty powerful wink of fate on your life to become one. Although one could increase the opportunities by working towards building a social presence. For example: blogging or showcasing your photography skills or any other hobby. But don't be disheartened if you do not make it big in these fields. The odds are heavily stacked against you. But if you never play the lottery, you never win the jackpot ;)
